# Grants are defined below.
# Each field aligns with information typically found in E-Trade grant documentation.

# Field descriptions:
# - grant_reason:   Optional field for user reference (e.g., "new hire", "promotion").
#
# - grant_value:    Total dollar value of the grant
# - grant_date:     The calendar month used to calculate RSUs (based on average close).
#                      Note: This is often different from the actual grant_date listed on E-Trade.
#       These two are used to estimate RSUs as:
#           RSUs = grant_value / average closing price of the grant_month.

# - vest_qty:        Total number of RSUs that have vested.
# - sellable_qty:    Total number of RSUs available for sale post-withholding.
#       
#       These two are used to estimate the sell-to-cover withholding rate

# - vest_plan: Defines what proportion of the grant vests each year.
#              Each year (y0 to y4) is represented as a list of 4 values,
#              corresponding to the 4 vesting dates per year as defined in VEST_SCHEDULE.
#                 i.e., for a given year's vest plan being [a, b, c, d]; 
#                       a refers to the amount vesting on the first vest date of the year and so on.
#     - y0:  The calendar year of the grant_month.
#     - y1â€“y4: Subsequent years, relative to y0.
